# Amazon_Alexa_Reviews

Very basic reviews prediction sentiment analysis. This is a difficult task because the 'actual' 
sentiment of the review is classified by the number of stars in the rating, while many people will 
leave negative comments, but still mark the review as 5 stars. To get around this a training dataset 
where a human marks each review as pos or neg could be helpful, though for the sake of this project it 
was a good exercise in basic sentiment analysis.
